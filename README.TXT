agileBase - a platform for lean business applications.

Use agileBase to rapidly prototype and develop data entry and reporting applications that work over the internet/intranet.

agileBase is perfect for organisations in rapidly changing environments, where scalability goes hand in hand with the need for a rapid build / alter cycle.

Our vision was to make a product that allows business analysts to create lean, agile, Just-In-Time (JIT) back offices.
