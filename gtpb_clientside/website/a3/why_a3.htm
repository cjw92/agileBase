		<div class="field_title">1) Why are we looking at this problem, now? (Urgency review)</div>
		<div class="field_display editable" >Rapid rate of change means we are needing to make an increasing number of strategic decisions quickly. Sometimes quality of decisions has suffered. Building consensus around these decisions has also become far harder.</div>

		<div class="field_title">2) Where are we now? (Situational analysis)</div>
		<div class="field_display editable" >Decision making is largely reserved for senior managers, valuable input from across the organisation has been overlooked on occasions and the process can be fraught. Informing staff and building consensus is adhoc, and staff seem confused. We are on a journey to becoming Lean.</div>

		<div class="field_title">3) Where do we want to be? (Desired future state)</div>
		<div class="field_display editable" >A better decision making approach. One that captures best practice for the service sector and that helps us delegate decision making authority appropriately and with confidence.</div>

		<div class="field_title">4) Why are we where we are now? (Root cause analysis)</div>
		<div class="field_display editable" >As a small organisation our decision making was adhoc but inclusive and effective. Our recent growth however has meant this approach is no longer viable.</div>
