		  The Lean community is buzzing about A3 reports. Take a look at Jim Womack's 2008 speech to the Lean Management Summit in India.

		<div class="field_display editable">Most consultants recognise the importance of Lean, however a survey by LEI shows widespread concern about embedding it in organisations, with 48% of respondents reporting "backsliding into old ways of working". In manufacturing the A3 process is coming to be seen as part of the solution to this issue.</div>

		<div class="field_title">4) Why is the service sector in this position? (Root cause analysis)</div>
		<div class="field_display editable">
		In the service sector paper based A3 reports do not work well as teams often work<br>
- from a number of offices, making collaboration difficult<br>
- in open plan offices or cubicles lacking wall space to display finished reports (a critical part of the process)<br>
- in areas the public have access to, which can lead to privacy concerns<br>
- in "front offices" that need to project a positive brand / image that A3s need to fit in with<br>
Progress checking often becomes an issue without a single up to date version of the report.

		<div class="field_display editable">Pilot this online A3 system that<br>
- enables staff to collaborate regardless of their location<br>
- enables individuals who lack dedicated wall space access a library of reports<br>
- a uniform look and feel to support a company image<br>
- ability to tailor the reports to our organisational language</div>
